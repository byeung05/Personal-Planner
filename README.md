## Project Description

<p> A personal planner/tracker that allows one to set and measure progress towards various goals. It will allow the user to set up tasks, milestones, and provide a progress report on current progress towards achieving a certain target. This application can be used by anyone for a variety of tasks such as setting weekly goals for language learning, tracking school assignments, or progress on a book.

This application is of particular interest to me as it can provide practical supplement towards daily routine and enhance productivity. Having a customized tool to properly visualize individual steps to achieve desired goals can help clarify future steps.
